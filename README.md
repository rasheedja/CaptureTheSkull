# Capture The Skull

'Capture The Skull' is a multiplayer capture the flag game. The game is programmed in Unity. You can play the game by donwloading the build from the releases tab and joining/creating a room. The networking in the game is provided by Photon which allows up to 16 players to play at once.

## Overview

Once you download the game, you can click the help button on the intro screen to see the controls and instructions on how to play the game. To start playing the game, click 'Jump In' on the intro screen. You will be shown a screen with an input box asking you for a room name. Here, you can create your own room or join an existing room.

Once you have created/joined a room, you must select a team, red or blue. After selecting your team, you will spawn in the game. You will be given an assault rifle, a pistol, and some grenades. Ammo can be found around the map and is picked up by walking over any floating guns/grenades that you see.

The goal of the game is to capture the enemy skull that can be found on a pyramid on the opposite side of where you spawn. You can pick up a skull by touching it. Holding a skull limits you to your secondary weapon (and grenades). To 'capture' the skull and score a point, you must bring the skull back to your own pyramid. If someone holding a skull dies, or a skull is captured, it is placed back on the pyramid it was taken from.

The game ends when a team scores 3 points or after five minutes have elapsed.
